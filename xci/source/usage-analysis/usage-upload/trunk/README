# Installing usage-upload:
#
Software pre-requisites:
  - Python with Virtualenv

Upload file pre-requisites:
  - Files should contain log entries or pre-parsed XSEDE standard usage records
  - Files should be rotated and include a date "YYYYMMDD" in the file name
  - The current un-dated log or usage record file should not be uploaded

1) Install to the default /usr/local/usage-upload or an alterate path
  $ mkdir /usr/local/usage-upload/
  $ mkdir /usr/local/usage-upload/downloads/
  $ cd /usr/local/usage-upload/downloads/
  # Download the desired production or development package from:
  $ wget https://software.xsede.org/{production,development}/ \
                usage-analysis/usage-upload-<ver>-<rel>.tgz
  $ tar -xzf usage-upload-<ver>-<rel>.tgz
  $ cd usage-upload-<ver>-<rel>/
  # Customize the Makefile to change defaults
  #   a.  Optionally customize the install PREFIX= /usr/local/usage-upload
  #   b.  Optionally customize the Python PYTHON_PREFIX and PYTHON_LIB
  $ vi Makefile
  $ make install

2) Generate SSH keys without a passpharse that this server will use to upload
  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /usr/local/usage-upload/etc/id_rsa

3) Request access to upload usage to xci-usage.xsede.org
  # Send to the Usage Collection Service (xci-usage.xsede.org) administrators
    by e-mailing help@xsede.org with Subject: XCI usage upload access
  a. The generated id_rsa.pub public key
  b. What application you are uploading usage for
  c. What host(s) you are uploading from

  # The reply will include instructions on what remote account and path to
  #     upload files to

# Setting up an application specific usage upload process
# This step can be repeated with different APP=... values
#

3) Initialize a custom upload application
  $ make APP=myapp-usage uploadapp

4) Configure the new custom upload application
  $ vi /usr/local/usage-upload/etc/upload_myapp-usage.conf

5) Test the new custom upload appplication
  $ /usr/local/usage-upload/bin/upload_myapp-usage.cron

6) Run automatically in cron
  CRON: 10 6 * * 0 /usr/local/usage-upload/bin/upload_myapp-usage.cron


###############################################################################
#
# How does an upload work?
#
  1. cron or interactive execution of
     bin/upload_myapp-usage.cron
  2. which executes bin/upload_usage.py with a custom configuration file
     etc/upload_myapp-usage.conf
  3. which scans a selected directory for files matching a configured glob
  4. selects files that haven't been uploaded or changed since uploaded
  5. parses/converts each file IF a parser was configured
  6. uploads each file or parsed/converted file to a configured target
  7. tracks previously uploaded files in a status file to not reprocess them
     /usr/local/usage-upload/etc/upload_myapp-usage_status.json
