# ipf-usage execution:
#    1. cron or interactive execution of upload_rabbitmq.sh
#    2. upload_rabbitmq.sh executes
#       upload_usage.py with a custom configuration file

Pre-requisites:
  - Python3 with Virtualenv

1) As root create the install directory owned by the account that will upload usage
  $ mkdir /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools
  $ chown -R <owner>.<group> /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools

For the remaining steps, switch to the account <owner> that will upload files

2) Install package(s) from the latest or desired <TAG>
  $ cd  /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools
  $ mkdir tags
  $ git clone --branch <TAG> https://github.com/XSEDE/XCI-Usage-Tools.git tags/<TAG>

3) Configure package(s)
  # Create local directories
  $ mkdir conf
  $ mkdir var

  # Generate SSH keys without a passphrase
  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f conf/id_rsa
  # Send the id_rsa.pub public key to the Usage Collection Service administrators

  # Create the configuration files
  $ cp /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools/PROD/usage-upload/conf/upload_rabbitmq.conf.example \
       /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools/conf/upload_rabbitmq.conf

  # Edit upload_rabbitmq.conf to configure


4) Generate a custom Python venv with some required packages
  # Build Python3 venv
  $ /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools/PROD/bin/python-venv-init.sh
  vi PROD/bin/upload_rabbitmq.sh

5) Test and run in production
  # Test by hand
  $ /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools/PROD/ipf-usage/bin/upload_rabbitmq.sh
  # Check logs in var/ and status in conf/
  # Install in cron
  0 6 * * 1 /soft/XCI-Usage-Tools/PROD/ipf-usage/bin/upload_rabbitmq.sh
